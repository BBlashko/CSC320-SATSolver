SAT Solver Summary:

The sudoku SAT Solver program transforms a 9x9 sudoku puzzle into an instance of the NP-complete SAT problem.
This transformation is processed by performing minimal encodings on the puzzle. 
The program begins by reading in the input file which is an unsolved 9x9 sudoku puzzle and it is minimally encoded
and then pushed into miniSAT.  MiniSAT will output if the problem is SATISFIABLE or UNSATISFIABLE.  In the case of the 
sudoku problem, it is indeed SATISFIABLE. The SAT output gets outputted to the text file "SATOutput.txt". 
The program will then attempt to decode the puzzle encoding and then finally produce the solution to the problem, by
outputting to the "SolvedPuzzle.txt" file.
